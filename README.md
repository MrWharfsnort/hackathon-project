Current was brought into the world by Charlotte Taylor, Adam Belliveau, Nate Farnsworth, Brendan O'Keefe while they were students at Code Craft School of Technology. This site was born in four short days thanks to a multitude of coffee and all the whiteboarding space that Code Craft has to offer.

It utilizes Javascript, Node, MongoDB, and HighCharts.js. 

The theme of the hackathon was to create an educational tool. Current's goal was to meter people as they spend the day working on a project. Users self-report when the eat, take breaks, have coffee, and Current takes that data in. When there is enough data the user sees a chart of when they were in their most productive work-flow and the circumstances that lead up to it.

Current is an idea that is based off of many previously-researched concepts and is backed by a plethora of research. We developed this idea because we think that this is an app that anyone can benefit from and truly better their life satisfaction.

We want to thank Code Craft for the pizza, working space, all the whiteboards, Erty & Sarah for their support and one another for not killing each other when someone broke something/the app crashed/scope was too large/tears were shed. Thank you
