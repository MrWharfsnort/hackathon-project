        	<h2>Flow and the Optimal Experience</h2>

			<p> Have you ever had those moments when you're "in the zone"? You seem to lose track of time and focus on only the task at hand. Athletes experience this often and enter this state when their skills match their opposing player or team, creating a challenge. In 1990, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a Hungarian psychologist published the book <em>Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</em> explaining Flow Psychology. In it, Csikszentmihalyi describes the flow state as so, "the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter[...] the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost". </p>
			<div class="clearfix"></div>
           
            <img class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset 1" src="https://www.usedbooksearch.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/explanation-of-flow.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Csikszentmihalyi uses this image to explain this flow state. In his research, he found that people were considered to be in flow if their perceived skills being used at a given moment were matched by an equally high perception of challenge at that moment. For sake of clarity, say the person being depicted in the graph is a tennis player. When beginning tennis, this person's skills are not very high, nor are the challenges they face- they may play against other novice players. Therefore, they will find themselves in a flow state as depicted by the bottom left grey circle. However if this tennis player's opponent is more skilled than he, his challenges increase while his skills remain the same, thus experiencing anxiety at his lack of skill, moving out of flow (the red circle). However, within the flow state of the first grey circle, if the novice player's skills increase but he continues to play against novice opponents, he will begin to experience boredom as depicted by the purple circle. Regardless of in the red circle (anxiety) or the pruple circle (boredom), the experience is not comfortable, thus forcing the player to make a decision: either increase his challenges, increase his skills, or quit the game all together (in which case he would drop off of the graph completely). If the player choices either of the first two choices, depending on his position at that given time, he will reenter the flow state once again (the upper righthand grey cirle. Despite this, this is also not a sustainable position as one cannot enjoy doing the same thing at the same level for long. We grow either bored or frustrated; and then the desire to enjoy ourselves again pushes us to stretch our skills, or to discover new opportunities for using them. </p>
            
            <div class="clearfix"></div>
			<p>In his research, Csikszentmihalyi found that the more time a person spent in flow during the week the better the overall quality of their reported experience. These people were especially likely to feel "strong", "active", "creative", "concentrated", "more cheerful", "stronger", "more creative", "satisfied" and "motivated". He explains this state as the "optimal experience"; "In the long run optimal experiences add up to a sense of mastery-- or perhaps better, a sense of participation in determining the content of life."
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Whenever the goal is to improve the quality of life, flow theory can point the way"</p>
                <small>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi <cite title="Source Title">Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</cite></small>
            </blockquote>

			<p>So if flow is so great, why don't people stay in it all the time? The reason is relatively simple: such experiences are not necessarially pleasant at the time they occur. Take the athlete example- Many times when an athlete enters this flow state they are exerting themselves physically to the point of exhaustion. However, the outcome, whether it be beating the opponent or meeting a personal goal is so intrinsicly satisfying and motivating that the experience overall becomes more positive in their mind. So although flow is enjoyable, people cannot stand high levels of challenge at all times and must recover. </p>

			<div class="clearfix"></div>
			<p>Additionally, "when it comes to work, people do not heed their senses. They disregard the quality of their immediate experience and base their motivation instead on the strongly-rooted cultural stereotype of what work is supposed to be like. They think of it as an imposition, a constraint, an infringement of their freedom, and therefore something that should be avoided as much as possible" rather than the means by which to enter a flow state and have the optimal experience</p>

            <h2>Consciousness & Attention</h2>
            <p> One of the most important mediators of flow state is our individual attention threshold. The nervous system has definite limits on how much information it can process at any given time. There are just so many “events” that can appear in consciousness and be recognized and handled appropriately before they begin to crowd each other out. </p>
            
            <p> It seems we can manage at most seven bits of information— such as differentiated sounds, or visual stimuli, or recognizable nuances of emotion or thought—at any one time, and that the shortest time it takes to discriminate between one set of bits and another is about <strong>1/18 of a second</strong>. By using these figures one concludes that it is possible to process at most <strong>126 bits</strong> of information per second, or <strong>7,560 per minute</strong>, or almost <strong>half a million per hour</strong>. Over a lifetime of seventy years, and counting sixteen hours of waking time each day, this amounts to about <strong>185 billion bits</strong> of information. <strong>It is out of this total that everything in our life must come—every thought, memory, feeling, or action</strong>. It seems like a huge amount, but in reality it does not go that far. </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"But even when there is nothing else  pressing occupying their minds, most people fall far below the peak capacity for processing information. In the roughly one-third of the day that is free of obligations, in their precious “leisure” time, most people in fact seem to use their minds as little as possible. The largest part of free time—almost half of it for American adults—is spent in front of the television set."</p>

            <p>Not surprisingly, people report some of the lowest levels of concentration, use of skills, clarity of thought, and feelings of potency when engaging in leisure activities.  Retrieving information from memory storage and bringing it into the focus of awareness, comparing information, evaluating, deciding—all make demands on the mind’s limited processing capacity. Some people learn to use this priceless resource efficiently, while others waste it. The mark of a person who is in control of consciousness is the ability to focus attention at will, to be oblivious to distractions, to concentrate for as long as it takes to achieve a goal, and not longer. And the person who can do this usually enjoys the normal course of everyday life. Thus, attention is our most important tool in the task of improving the quality of experience.</p>

            <p>In his research, Csikszentmihalyi explains psychic entropy as a disorganization of the self that impairs its effectiveness. Prolonged experiences of this kind can weaken the self to the point that it is no longer able to invest attention and pursue its goals. However, the opposite state from the condition of psychic entropy is optimal experience.  </p>

            <h2>Impact of Work & Leisure</h2>
            <p> We have seen that experience depends on the way we invest psychic energy—on the structure of attention. This, in turn, is related to goals and intentions. These processes are connected to each other by the self, or the dynamic mental representation we have of the entire system of our goals. These are the pieces that must be maneuvered if we wish to improve things. Sleep, rest, food, and sex provide restorative homeostatic experiences that return consciousness to order after the needs of the body intrude and cause psychic entropy to occur. But they do not produce psychological growth. They do not add complexity to the self. Pleasure helps to maintain order, but by itself cannot create new order in consciousness. </p>
            
            <p> This, in turn, explains how flow can improve quality of life, but because challenge is not sustainable, restorative homeostatic experiences are necessary to achieve and maintain flow. Csikszentmihalyi continues to explain that is is through the societal construction of understanding of work that people become so averse to work as a concept when in actuality, people who enter flow are more likely to enjoy work than other aspects of their life. </p>
            <div class="clearfix"></div>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"In fact, working people achieve the flow experience—deep concentration, high and balanced challenges and skills, a sense of control and satisfaction—about four times as often on their jobs, proportionately, as they do when they are watching television."</p>

            <div class="clearfix"></div>
            <p> Csikszentmihalyi explains this by saying that we can experience pleasure without any investment of psychic energy, whereas enjoyment happens only as a result of unusual investments of attention, thus demonstrating the importance of directing our consciousness and attention.</p>

            <p>Csikszentmihalyi explains that our generation has significantly more options for leisure than previous generations, however our generation does not report being happier. The leisure available to us is culminated to watching other perform music, act, or play sports rather than engaging in them ourselves. "This vicarious participation is able to mask, at least temporarially, the underlying emptiness of wasted time. The energy that could be used to focus on complex goals, to provide for enjoyable growth, is squandered on patterns of stimulation that only mimic reality. Mass leisure, mass culture and even high culture when only attended to passively and for extrinsic reasons[...] are parasites of the mind. They absorb psychic energy without providing substantive strength in return. They leave us more exhausted, more disheartened than we were before" </p>

            <p> So when should one work to be most productive? James B. Duke Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke University, talked about productivity and time of day in a Reddit Ask Me Anything Q&A. He pointed out that the first two hours of the day are when most people are most alert, and when they have the propensity to be the most productive. Howver, other researchers have demonstrated that the most productive time of day differs individually. </p>
            
            <p> According to research, there is no exact time of day where every single person is more or less productive, but on average the majority of humans are more productive during morning hours.  </p>

            <p>One study showed that evening people show increased motor cortex and spinal cord excitability in the evening, about 9 p.m., meaning they had maximal central nervous system drive at that time, Lagerquist said.
        Morning people, on the other hand, never achieve this level of central nervous system drive because the excitability of the motor cortex does not coincide with the excitability of the spinal cord. In other words, these two measures never peak at the same time, he said. Early birds' brains were most excitable at 9 a.m. and slowly decreased throughout the day.. </p>

            <h2>Impact of Taking Breaks</h2>
            <p> All of these factors coupled together indicate the incredible importance of taking breaks (and what is done on breaks) to maximize productivity and enter a flow state, therefore increasing life and work satisfaction. Csikszentimihalyi explains, "Not surprisingly, people report some of the lowest levels of concentration, use of skills, clarity of thought, and feelings of potency when watching television. The other leisure activities people usually do at home are only a little more demanding. Reading most newspapers and magazines, talking to other people, and gazing out the window also involve processing very little new information, and thus require little concentration". If people are using such methods to disconnect from the challenges of work, they are, in turn, not effectively directing their attention and actually inhibiting their own ability to become more productive at work. </p>
            
            <p> Research indicated that what the most productive users have in common is their ability to take effective breaks. The employees with the highest productivity ratings, in fact, don't even work eight-hour days. Turns out, the secret to retaining the highest level of productivity over the span of a workday is not working longer—but working smarter with frequent breaks.</p>

                <p>After a while, you begin to lose your focus and your performance on the task declines. Some researchers believe that this "vigilance decrement," as they describe it, is the result of a drop in one's "attentional resources"</p>

            <p>In one new study, Lleras and postdoctoral fellow Atsunori Ariga tested participants' ability to focus on a repetitive computerized task for about an hour under various conditions. The 84 study subjects were divided into four groups: The control group performed the 50-minute task without breaks or diversions. The "switch" group and the "no-switch" group memorized four digits prior to performing the task, and were told to respond if they saw one of the digits on the screen during the task. Only the switch group was actually presented with the digits (twice) during the 50-minute experiment. Both groups were tested on their memory of the digits at the end of the task. The "digit-ignored" group was shown the same digits presented to the switch group during the task, but was told to ignore them. As expected, most participants' performance declined significantly over the course of the task. But most critically, Lleras said, those in the switch group saw no drop in their performance over time. Simply having them take two brief breaks from their main task (to respond to the digits) allowed them to stay focused during the entire experiment. </p>

            <p>Another study found that productivity, eye, leg and foot comfort all improved when the short breaks included stretching exercises. These results provide evidence that frequent short breaks from continuous computer-mediated work can benefit worker productivity and well-being when the breaks integrate with task demands. </p>
            <p>-Another study explains, "Compared with engaging in a demanding task, rest, or no break, engaging in an undemanding task during an incubation period led to substantial improvements in performance on previously encountered problems. Critically, the context that improved performance after the incubation period was associated with higher levels of mind wandering. These data suggest that engaging in simple external tasks that allow the mind to wander may facilitate ceative problem solving.In other words, a break in intense concentration may increase unconscious associative processing. That, in turn, allows us to perceive connections that we would otherwise miss."</p>

            <h2>Impact of Caffeine</h2>
            <p> Caffeine blocks the activity of a substance (adenosine) that promotes sleep and regulatory functions. It  had a profound effect on the quality of that sleep: it lowered sleep efficiency; the duration of stage-two sleep (the point at which our bodies prepare to enter deep sleep); and the spectral power of delta-wave frequencies (which are closely associated with the depth and quality of sleep). In one study, consuming two hundred milligrams of caffeine significantly increased the amount of time it took for people to fall asleep later that night. (An eight-ounce cup of brewed coffee contains ninety-five to two hundred milligrams of caffeine, according to the Mayo Clinic.) During rem, participants' brains were able to integrate unassociated information so that, upon waking up, they were more adept at solving problems they had been primed with earlier. Without sound sleep, the effect dissipated.

                <p>"Creativity—whether writing a sonnet or a mathematical proof—has to do with the ability to link ideas, entities, and concepts in novel ways. This ability depends in part on the very thing that caffeine seeks to prevent: a wandering, unfocussed mind."</p>

            <div class="clearfix"></div>
            <p>The consumption of caffeine impairs the ability to fall asleep, and thus impairs memory retention and the ability to learn new concepts on top of inhibiting the creative flow that is necessary in problem solving. Caffeine consumption also makes people less likely to take the breaks that are nececessary in entering and maintaining a flow state. </p>
